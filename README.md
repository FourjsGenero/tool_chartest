Program to help test appearance of characters in fonts on the screen and in reports

Type the character into the character field, or enter the integer or hex equivalanet into the fields immediately below.  These 3 fields are kept in sync, that is if you type character into field, the integer and hex numbers change, if you type a value into integer, value in character and hex will change, and finally if you type a value into hex, value in character and integer will change.

Select a font from the COMBOBOX's or override by typing a font into the override font fields.  The appearance of the field in the GUI will change to reflect the selected font, or you can generate a SVG of PDF report

The environment group lists the value of selected environment variables used by the program.

To launch the program again with different environment variables, type them into the fields in the Launch Environment group and click Launch With Above Environment
